# CNN-Travel-News-Article-Scraper

## Introduction
I built a simple web scraper that will return the content of cnn travel news article when given a specific URL. Some examples of real products which use similar technologies include price-tracking websites and SEO audit tools which may scrape top search results. This project may took me around 4 hours to complete.

The python libraries used where:
  - Request library
    - This was used to connect tot the news site.
  - Beautifulsoup library
    - This was used to scrape the content in the articles from the site link.

## Output
The articles where stored in .txt format
